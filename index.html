      <h3>Ammar Shoaib</h3>
      <p> Before coming to city, I did A levels in Maths, Physics, and Computer Science. 
	Since I did CompSci, i do have experiance in programming, where i mainly used
	C# but also used SQL when working with databases. I also did java in high school
	for 2 years but didn't use it after leaving school and so don't remember much on
	java, though hopefully that changes soon.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Coloured ball collusion.</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). To keep it short, this project tests the uses of loops, arrays, 
	and the use of classes, as well as randomness. It creates multiple circles 
	in the sketch and gives each circle a colour, which is either red or blue.
	It spawns them on random spots in the sketch and then moves them in a random
	direction at random speeds. In this case, the balls would collide and so if 
	they are the same colour, they merge together and continue to move in the 
	direction of one of the balls. If they aren't the same colour, they bounce
	 of each other, changing their direction.
